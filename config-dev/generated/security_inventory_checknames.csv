NCSMBv1,Network Configuration SMBv1,"This test determines the status of Server Message Block version 1. SMBv1 is a network protocol that provides shared access to files, printers, and serial ports within a network. SMBv1, while still functional, is an outdated version of the protocol and is known to have several security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to network resources or execute arbitrary code."
NCSMBSign,Network Configuration SMB Signing,"This test determines the configuration of Server Message Block (SMB) Signing. SMB signing means that each SMB message has a signature generated using the session key. Connections not secured with SMB Signing are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers can intercept and modify communications between the client and server."
NCNetBIOS,Network configuration NetBIOS,This test determines the status of NetBIOS over TCP/IP. NetBIOS is an aged network technology that poses security risks such as vulnerability to poisoning attacks.
