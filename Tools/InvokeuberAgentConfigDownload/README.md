# InvokeuberAgentConfigDownload

## Description

While the configuration for uberAgent UXM remains relatively static, the configuration for uberAgent ESA changes daily due to regular updates to the included Sigma rules.

To make your life easier, we provide a PowerShell script that automates the configuration file pulling, filtering, and bundling.

You can find examples in the [Syntax and Examples](#syntax-and-examples) section for the most common use-cases:
- **Example 1**: you have a customized `uberAgent.conf` that should persist, but all other configuration files should be on the latest version available on GitHub.
- **Example 2**: you applied several customizations in the configuration files that should persist, but all TDE rules and SCI tests should be on the latest version available on GitHub.
- **Example 3**: you want the latest TDE rules from GitHub with a few exceptions.

## Development
The script covers the most common use-cases. If you want to see examples for other use-cases or have ideas to extend the script, please do not hesitate to create a GitHub issue or a pull request. Or contact us via [support@uberagent.com](mailto:support@uberagent.com).

    -uAConfigArchive <Boolean>
        Creates an uberAgent.uAConfig archive from the target directory. The uberAgent.uAConfig is placed in the root 
        of the target folder.
        The archive is downloaded by the endpoint agents and applied if meaningful changes are found. See 
        https://uberagent.com/docs/uberagent/latest/advanced-topics/auto-application-of-configuration-changes/.
        Default is true.

    -ForceVersionUpdate <Boolean>
        This updates the version setting in the uberAgent.conf so that the endpoint agent is forced to restart and 
        update the config even if there were no meaningful changes.
        Requires an existing uberAgent.conf in the target directory.
        Default is false.
