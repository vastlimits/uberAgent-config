## Repository Structure

### uberAgent Versions & Git Branches

This repository is organized in such a way that uberAgent releases are represented by Git branches. Each Git branch contains rules that are compatible with the matching uberAgent release.

| uberAgent version | Git branch |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| `development (beta)` | [develop](../../tree/develop) |
| `7.2.x` | [version/7.2](../../tree/version/7.2) |
| `7.1.x` | [version/7.1](../../tree/version/7.1) |
| `7.0.x` | [version/7.0](../../tree/version/7.0) |
| `6.2.x` | [version/6.2](../../tree/version/6.2) |

### Folder Structure

| Folder        | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `config`      | Compiled configuration as individual source files. Use the contents of this folder for your **deployment with any uberAgent version**. |
| `config-dev`  | Contains files that cannot be used without further processing, such as transpilation. Do not use the contents of this folder on your endpoints unless you know what you're doing. |
| `config-dist` | Compiled configuration as configuration archive (`*.uAConfig`). Use the contents of this folder for your **deployment with uberAgent 7.1+**. |

## Automating uberAgent Configuration Updates

While the configuration for uberAgent UXM remains relatively static, the configuration for uberAgent ESA changes daily due to regular updates to the included Sigma rules.

To make your life easier, we provide a PowerShell script that automates the configuration file pulling, filtering, and bundling. You can find more information in [Tools/InvokeuberAgentConfigDownload](Tools/InvokeuberAgentConfigDownload).
